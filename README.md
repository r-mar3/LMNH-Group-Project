## Hi, I'm a Technician who helped setup the raspberry pi sensors.

- I want to make sure the sensors are working by visualising the live data they capture every minute using the recording taken time.
- Why? Because I want my efforts building this API and sensor connection to not be in vain.

- I want to know if a sensor is runnning into an error by visualising or alerting me based on the error column.

## Hi, I'm Financially invested in the museum.

- I want to see what plants are cheaper / require less water to maintain (soil_moisture).
- Why? This would help me know what plants/species to look out for when planning our plant expansion.
  
- I want to know which botanists are recoding the most readings.
- Why? To ensure one botanist is not doing all the readings, and also to rewards the botanists going out of their way to work more.
